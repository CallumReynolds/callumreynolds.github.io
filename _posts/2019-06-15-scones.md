Ingrediants:
* 3 cups self-raising flour

* 1/2 cup cream
* 1 & 1/2 cups milk

Steps:
1. Preheat oven to 240C and grease a baking tray
2. Sift flour and salt into a bowl, and into the centre add the cream and milk. Stir with a knife to form a soft
dough. Turn out onto a floured board nd knead lightly. Roll to about 12mm in thickness and, using a 5cm cutter, cut out the scones. Place side by side on baking tray.
3. Cook in a very hot oven (240C) for 10 minutes. When cooked, remove from oven and brush tops with melted butter to enhance their appearance.
