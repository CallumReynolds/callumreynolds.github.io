Ingrediants:
* 2 to 3 red chillis, seeded
* Onion, peeled and quartered
* 3 Cloves garlic, peeled
* 3 Tablespoons oil
* 500g Rump or topside beef, thinly sliced

Steps:
1. Place chillies, onion and garlic into a food processor or blender and puree until almost smooth.
2. Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a wok or large frying pan. Fry meat until well browned (you may have to do this in batches) and set aside.
3. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil to pan and stir-fry chilli paste over a moderate heat for 4 minutes or until golden brown.
4. Stir in beef, oyster sauce, fish sauce, water and capsicum and fry for a further 2 minutes or until meat is cooked. Serve sprinkled with chopped coriander.
