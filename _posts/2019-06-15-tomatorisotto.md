Prep time: 10 mins
Cook time: 35 mins
Serves 4

Ingrediants:
* 1L salt-reduced chicken stock
* 1/3 cup olive oil
* 1 brown onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 1 & 1/2 cups arborio rice
* 400g can finely chopped tomatoes
* 1 & 1/4 cups fresh basil leaves
* 3/4 cup finely grated parmesan

Steps:
1. Heat stock in a medium sauepan over high heat until simmering. Remove from heat. Stand, covered, until required.
2. Heat 1 tbs of the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and stir for 3 minutes or until softened. Add rice and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until rice is translucent at edges. Stir tomatoes.
3. Add 1/2 cup stock to pan. Cook, stirring, until absorbed. Repeat with remaining stock, 1/2 cup at a time, until liquid has absorbed and rice is tender (about 20 minutes).
4. Meanwhile, reserve some small basil leaves for garnish. Combine remaining basil and remaining oil in a blender or small food processor and process until smooth.
5. Stir half the parmesan into risotto. Serve risotto topped with remaining parmesan, basil oil and reserved leaves.
